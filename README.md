## Q.1 - Library Information System
### Functional Requirements:
* The system should enable users to view every book that is available in the library.
* Members will be able to easily borrow and return books while seated at their workstation or table.
* If there are no other reservations in line, the system should allow them to extend the book's loan period.
* It will make daily book transactions easier.
* The librarian would be aware of every transaction and could add any new books to the database.
* If a book is taken off the shelf, he can alter the availability of other books.
* This system would only function on the Institute's LAN network.
* This serves as a secure place for the system and lowers the risk to it.
* Anyone without a membership may use the system to browse or look for books online.
* Members of the Institute should have their login credentials authenticated.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

* Security - Passwords and other private information shouldn't be stored in plain text.Users must verify their identity using the email address provided by the Institute and a password they have chosen.
* Performance - The borrowing or return request procedure should take no longer than 15 seconds.
* Maintibility - If there is heavy traffic, the site should load in 5 seconds.
* Flexibility - A website should be portable, meaning it should run on all OS.
* Scalibility - The website should be able to accommodate sizable numbers at a time as the institute is growing.
* When building the website, modern HTML 5 should be used.
* After sending users an email alert, the system should be offline for a set period of time.

## Q2.Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

### Scope
* For persons with hearing impairments, we are developing an Android app. In this, artificial intelligence will be used to distinguish the important sounds, such as car horns, infant cries, machinery operating, etc. The user will receive an immediate alarm when this sound is heard, which will be highly beneficial to them. This affects a large number of people; around 5% of the world's population has hearing impairments.

### Features:
* Key sounds are recognised using artificial intelligence.
* It can be used on any OS because it is a mobile application.
* After hearing sounds, it displays alerts to users.
* For the user, continuous logging is essential.
* For prolonged use, apps utilize less power and have minimal latency.
* The app's predictions ought to be correct.
* If the user is not responding in a critical scenario, alerts should be sent to family members and friends whose information has been entered.

### Non-Functional Aspects:
* It is a real-time, low latency Android application.
* Users should be logged in at all times to prevent problems when important situations arise.
* Within two to three seconds, it should pick up sound.
* In urgent instances, a message should be sent to family members and friends whose contact information has been provided.
* Plain text should never be used to store personal information.
* In case of an emergency, the app should be able to track the user's whereabouts.
* The app should recommend to users routes with reduced traffic.
